# 🎬 Movie Rating App

This is a small personal project I built to use with **two friends**.  
The main purpose of this app is to **keep track of movie ratings** that we give together.

This project is mainly for **learning and practice**.  
I’m still a **beginner developer**, so the code may not be perfect, but it works for our use case 🙂

- Add a movie with a date
- Each person can give their own score
- One score can be added first, the other can be updated later
- View rating history
- Edit data directly from the UI
- Store everything in a local SQLite database

It’s just a simple app to make movie nights more fun 😄
